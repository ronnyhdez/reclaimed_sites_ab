This file is using the geojson file exported from GEE on 20250111 to drive
and then locally. Idea is to use polars for getting the tabular data
descriptive statistics and geopandas for using the polygons of each
of the abandoned wells.

The exported data file contains the 1000 filtered polygons and randomly 
selected.


```{python}
import ee
import json
import os
import sys
import glob
import geemap
import pickle
import polars as pl
import seaborn as sns
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
wells_df = pl.read_json('wells_export.geojson')
buffers_df = pl.read_json('buffers_export.geojson')

# For spatial operations/visualization
# wells_gdf = gpd.read_file('wells_export.geojson')
# buffers_gdf = gpd.read_file('buffers_export.geojson')
```

## Abandoned wells characteristics

First, let's check the structure of the GeoJson file we just
read:

```{python}
wells_df.schema
```

That's kind of a messy printing hard to understand, specially if
it is new data for us that we are not familiared with. What we can
see at first glance is that we have two columns: `type` and `features`

The `type` column is a `string` and the `features` column is a `list`
with a struct and then everything is too coupled together to understand
easily. Let's try to print it in a more understandable way with the `json`
package:

```{python}
single_row = wells_df.head(1)
single_row
```

So, we got the first row (we have just one row in this Polars dataframe)
and the print is telling us the `shape`: 1 row and 2 columns. Basically
what we saw before but less clutered. Then, we have that `features` is
`list[struct[4]]`. This means that we have a list with a struct with
4 fields.

```{python}
features = single_row.get_column('features')
features 
```

Now we have printed just the features column, we can start digging
deeper into its structure. Let's get first the list

```{python}
features[0]
```

The difference is that we can see the first sections of each print:

```{python}
#| eval: false
shape: (1,)
Series: 'features' [list[struct[4]]]

# ---------------

shape: (1_000,)
Series: '' [struct[4]]
```

The first one is telling us that we have a list of features where each
structure has 4 components. 

```{python}

# Now let's examine the first feature's properties
first_feature = features[0][0]  # Get the first item from the first row
print("Properties in our data:")
print(json.dumps(first_feature['properties'], indent=2))
```




```{python}
wells_df.head()
```

```{python}
wells_df.shape
```

```{python}
wells_df.columns
```
