This file is intended to be a reference of the resulting datasets we have so
far. Before the sampler process, there is a script `create_sampler_assets.py`
which create two assets to be consumed by the `run_sampler.py` script which
will create a group of pkl files with produces Level 2 Vegetation Biophysical 
Products (LEAF-toolbox)

Things to do:

 - List variables from abandoned_wells
 - List variables from reference buffers
 - List variables in pkl files.
 - Define dataset from batches of pkl files
 - Join datasets (unified pkl file with abandoned_wells)
 - Join datasets (unified pkl file with reference_buffers)
 - Number of observations, description of datasets etc.
